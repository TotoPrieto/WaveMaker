# ðŸ§± WaveMaker - 3D Model Components

This repository contains 3D model files (`.stl`) designed for the mechanical parts of the **WaveMaker** system. These models were created to support the wave generation mechanism inside a small water tank.

## ðŸ“¦ Components Overview

### ðŸ”© Slider

- Designed to be driven by a threaded rod via a nut that is inserted into the slider.
- Includes slots to mount linear roller bearings.
- Bearings can be secured using zip ties (cable ties).
- Improves stability and reduces friction during vertical movement.

### ðŸ§² Main Body

- One side features a slot for a **ball bearing** to stabilize the threaded rod.
- The opposite side includes a mounting space for a **NEMA17 Stepper Motor (1.8Âº)**.
- Provides structural support for the entire movement mechanism.

### ðŸª¨ Wedge (Wave Generator)

- The wedge is a hollow structure used to generate waves inside the tank.
- Comes with a **removable top lid** that can be screwed in place.
- The hollow body allows for optional filling (e.g., sand, water, weights) to **increase mass and wave impact**.
